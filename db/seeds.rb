  {title: "How to Help the Nepal Earthquake Relief Effort",
   body: "<p>More than six million people live in the regions affected by the 7.8 magnitude earthquake that shook Nepal over the weekend. The quake and its aftershocks have left <i>over 3,000 people dead and almost 6,000 more injured</i>. Complicating things is the fast-approaching monsoon season, which generally begins around June.</p><p>The world has mobilized to support Nepal in its time of need. Several countries— including Nepal’s neighbors India and China and European countries like the UK and Norway—have already sent aid in the form of disaster response teams and financial assistance for charities already at work in the relief effort. A U.S. disaster response team of around 70 people is also expected to arrive on scene in Nepal today.</p><p>For those of us at home who want to help, many of the groups working hard on the ground are accepting donations for relief efforts in Nepal. This money will go to getting more response and search-and-rescue teams out there, as well as providing resources that are desperately needed by so many newly-homeless survivors, including plastic sheeting and other temporary shelter, drinking water—which is already of limited supply under normal circumstances in Nepal—and medical supplies like bandages and trauma kits.</p><p>Here, a list of organizations below where you can donate towards the Nepal relief effort:</p><p><a href='https://donate.salvationarmyusa.org/sawso/nepal-earthquake-disaster-relief'>The Salvation Army</a></p><p><a href='https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/nepal-earthquake-donate?source=LPFBN1504'>International Medical Corps</a></p><p><a href='https://handicapinternational.nationbuilder.com/donate_now_nepal_emergency'>Handicap International</a></p>",

  {title: "How To Seem Like You Can Navigate A Wine List, When You Definitely Can’t",
   body: "<p>We’ve all been there. You’re at dinner with someone that you hope will find you appealing as a human being, whether it be to breed with, to do business with, or just to share stories about cats with. Then the wine list ends up in your hands and you either blindly choose something that you proceed to pronounce as “Cabinet Frank,” or you freeze up completely.</p><p>As someone who has studied wine a little bit (and drank wine a lot), allow me to present one basic approach that will at the very least make you seem knowledgable, if not very breedable.</p><p>All you have to do is follow these 7 simple steps.</p><p>1. <b>Start with how much you want to spend.</b></p><p>And be direct, even if it’s $40. Good restaurants take pride in having good value on their list, and the sommelier/wine person will be glad you told them regardless of your budget.</p><p>2. <b>Decide between red or white.</b></p><p>3. <b>Do not, under any circumstance, say “white zinfandel.”</b></p><p>4. <b>Pick a country or large wine producing region.</b></p><p>If you are unsure, play it safe and probably say France or California, just for the sake of simplicity and because you’ll find bottles from both on almost every list. Italy will work too, but follow up questions may get awkward because there are so many grapes and regions in that country.</p><p>5. <b>Be confident.</b></p><p><span style='line-height: 1.42857;'>&nbsp; Even if you have no idea what you’re saying.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style='line-height: 1.42857;'>6. <b>Ask for input.</b></span></p><p>Leaving much of this open ended allows for the wine person to help guide you.</p><p>7. <b>Never pronounce a “t.”</b></p><p>Just to be safe.</p><p>But most importantly, the person sitting across from you will be impressed with your ability to take control of the situation, even if you do end up confessing that you have no idea what exactly the two of you are currently drinking.</p>",

  {title: "That’s Not Food, It’s madness",
   body: "<p>Look at that thing. Take it in.</p><p>The photo you see before you is a full lobster, <i>including</i> its shell, sitting on top of a pizza. As you examine this image, you might find yourself wondering why one would put a lobster shell on top of pizza, instead of, say, just the edible parts of the arthropod. You might also find yourself wondering why there are little “legs” made of red pepper slices laid out on the pie. Is this a small child’s contribution to “crazy food day” in Ms. Peterson’s second grade social studies class? Was it made for a longshoreman’s retirement party?</p><p>Unfortunately, it is neither of those things. It’s an actual dish served at an actual New York City restaurant, and it represents the pinnacle of a trend that’s been in the making for some time. And now it’s time for it to come to an end.</p><p>Maybe if it takes some frankenstein food abomination to get people to pay attention to what you’re doing, you’re doing something wrong. There are certainly plenty examples of smart business owners succesfully marketing on the platform, Dominique Ansel being one of them. The Cronut™ will be studied in graduate level marketing classes for decades to come. But that’s a unicorn example and — most importantly — Cronuts™ are actually really good. That lobster pizza is not, and neither is that funfetti birthday cake avocado toast that just popped up in your feed.</p><p>Let’s be clear that this is not an appeal to restaurants to stop marketing themselves. Lord knows it’s hard enough to figure out how to do that in the first place, especially with limited resources. Nor is it an appeal to the people of Instagram to stop liking and sharing these things, or wanting to experience them. This is simply my public wish that we all decide right now to agree that some things are food, <i>and some things are just </i><b>stupid</b>.</p><p>And it’s not hard to tell which is which.</p>",

  {title: "Drink wine instead of tomato juice",
   body: "<p>I think most of us know Etgar Keret. Google says that he is: “an Israeli poet of Polish origin… best known for his stories. He is often considered a master of the short form.(…) His works are translated into many languages”. I really enjoy his short stories and I even played a small role in one of them.</p><p>Keret’s writing is concise and I really like it. He is able to tell an interesting story on two or three pages. Actually, he opens the stories and then the sentences start to breathe like wine in an opened bottle, gaining depth. We watch his characters through an open window, and when we stop watching them — they continue their lives, they do not fall asleep.</p><p>The story, in which I had an opportunity to meet the author is entitled “<b>Flight Meditations</b>” and it is a part of his last book “<b>The Seven Good Years</b>”. The author meditates in the air — he describes his time on board of airplanes during his book promotion travels. Time is thinning in the clouds. It is not wasted by browsing airline shopping catalogues again and again. It is not wasted by watching silly movies. It is not wasted by small talks with other passengers when queueing to the toilet at the back of the airplane.</p><p>I stood in such a queue, when I heard someone behind me asking:</p><p>— <i>Cool socks, are they from the catalogue?</i></p><p>I really had cool socks (decorated with a reproduction of “The Scream” by Edvard Munch) and I bought them in a designer boutique in San Francisco. I turned around just to see the biggest surprise of this flight — Etgar Keret!</p><p>— <i>Thanks — I said — No, not from the catalogue. Mr. Keret, right</i>?</p><p>— <i>Right— he said, shaking my hand — You can call me Etgar.</i></p><p>We talked for a while and when it was my turn to enter the toilet, I gave way to Etgar. It seemed that tomato juice did not serve him well. When we were leaving, I said to him that drinking wine is safer (but reading the end of his short story I saw that this advice was ignored).</p><p>I returned to my seat. For a while I contemplated recent moments. The captain informed us that we were about to land. Not thinking much, I reached for the airline shopping catalogue and I started flipping through it. Oh … it’s my socks!</p>",

  {title: "Augmented Reality - Beyond the First-Down Line",
   body: "<p>The military is using it to train their off-site troops. Medical Doctors are implementing it to visualize and resect tumors in practice. IKEA has adopted it to help customers see how furniture would look in their homes. Apple recently claimed several patents in an attempt to safeguard a stake in the sector, and Google is developing a mobile device that is tailored for it.</p><p><b>So, what exactly is 'it'? </b></p><p>Well, most generally, “it” is Augmented Reality, or AR for short. The term alone though provides little insight into the scale or scope of this technology. I have seen many applications for it so far, but for newcomers, the question remains: Why is it adding value across so many verticals, and why it is seeing such rapid growth (current projections peg the industry to be valued at nearly 2 billion dollars by 2015). As someone who works at Metaio to bring some of the most ambitious and complex AR projects to market, I spend a lot of time answering these questions for individuals who have high interest in augmented reality, but struggle understanding it in a broader context. In the coming weeks I intend to shed light on this topic via LinkedIn postings, providing a sort of ad hoc solution to an apparent demand for industry knowledge amongst the professionals in my network. Without further ado, here's the plain and simple about a technology that is currently finding its place in our world, and how we're quickly realizing that it’s place is everywhere.</p><p><b>Where do we see augmented reality?</b></p><p>For those of you who spend your Monday nights cheering (and sometimes criticizing) your favorite football teams, then augmented reality is all too familiar. The bold yellow line that commonly represents a first down is in fact augmented on top of the field, serving as a useful marker to compare with a team’s yardage. The line does not in fact exist in reality, but is digitally painted into the video feed, adding much a much appreciated visual representation of that invisible concept that is the “Down Line”. Augmented reality in sports is so useful, in fact, that it has become an industry standard for all professional and collegiate football games, and has since been adapted for enhanced viewing with other sports as well, such as basketball, tennis, and hockey to name a few.</p><p>Regardless of whether or not you watch sports, the principle behind the example is of importance here. Augmented reality technology lets you see important additions to reality in tandem with what you see naturally. It enhances your reality with digital content, and, to be frank, it’s damn useful. </p><p>AR software has reached a level of sophistication that demands the attention of some of the largest companies which exist today, not to mention the military. In terms of what information we can digitally paint into the real world, the technology has made it far beyond that yellow first down line. We can now take just about any information that exists in the digital world and place it as contextually relevant places in our real world. </p><p>And the kicker? All of this can be achieved with the smart phone in your pocket.</p><p>In the coming posts I will go in depth across the most relevant applications we are seeing with AR today, as well as provide useful examples, metrics, and information regarding its most recent areas of growth. So for now, stay tuned.</p>",

#    body: "<p>NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope is tasked with finding small, rocky worlds orbiting distant stars. However, exoplanets aren’t the only thing Kepler can detect — stellar flares, star spots and dusty planetary rings can also pop up in the mission’s observations.</p><p>But there’s also been speculation that Kepler may have the ability to detect more than natural phenomena; if they’re out there, Kepler may also detect the signature of <i>artificial structures</i> orbiting other stars. Imagine an advanced civilization that’s well up on the <u><b>Kardashev scale</b></u> and has the ability to harness energy directly from its star. This hypothetical alien civilization may want to construct vast megastructures, like supersized solar arrays in orbit around their host star, that could be so big that they blot out a sizable fraction of starlight as they pass in front.</p><p>The next step is to point a radio antenna at KIC 8462852, just to see whether the system is generating any artificial radio signals that could indicate the presence of something we’d define as “intelligent.” Boyajian and Wright have now teamed up with Andrew Siemion, the Director of the SETI Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley, to get a radio telescope to listen into the star and if they detect an artificial signal, they will request time on the Very Large Array (VLA) to deduce whether any radio signals from that star are the chatter of an alien civilization.</p><p>It might be a long shot, and the phenomenon is more likely a clump of comets or some other natural phenomenon that we haven’t accounted for blocking star light from view, but it’s worth investigating, especially if there really is some kind of alien intelligence building structures, or perhaps, ancient structures of a civilization long-gone, around a star only 1,500 light-years away from Earth.</p><p><b><u>Article originally published on Discovery News</u></b></p>"
